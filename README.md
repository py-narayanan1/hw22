hw22_visweswaran
==============================

What if excel analysis

The 2 parts of the homework are done in the same folder .i.e. the notebooks folder and have been created in 2 seperate ipynb files , Part_1 and Part_2 respectively.
The Part_1 has the whatif.py i.e. renamed as hw2_visweswaran.py in the original notebooks folder and also the src folder to avoid any confusion , so that everything goes smoothly.  The Part_1 has created both cases in the end , both scenario based and non scenario based to see the effect of selling price also  on the distribution of the profit.

The Part_2 excel files to be inputted are placed in the input folder and the resultant excel files are placed in the output folder inside the notebooks folder . For the hacker part of the second part , the input files are placed in a folder named logs_hacker inside the input folder inside the notebooks folder and their corresponding outputs are placed in the output_hacker folder inside the notebooks folder . The code created for the hacker part is such that the files are differentiated as per their first three letters and are placed in seperate excel workbooks.

Lastly all the commits have been made to the git repository .
